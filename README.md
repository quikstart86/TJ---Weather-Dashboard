## [Acceptance Criteria](#acceptance-criteria)

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a weather dashboard that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

* Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
* When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    - The city name
    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity
    - The wind speed
* When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity
* When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city* Persist events between refreshes of a page

### Technical Acceptance Criteria:

Satisfies all of the above acceptance criteria plus the following:

## [Installation](#installation)

I started by creating a new repo on GitHub giving it a unique name and then cloning it to my local environment using GitBash. I then created several files including one for HTML/CSS/JS and an assets folder. I created an index.html / script.js / style.css file in gitbash using 'touch' and then began to work through the files. Coding in HTML first to create the structure, and then once sufficiently built out, I proceeded to work on the JavaScript and CSS. With any new major features/changes to the the code I added (git add -A) the changes, committed the changes (git commit -m " ") and then pushed them up to my remote repo on GitHub (git push origin).
